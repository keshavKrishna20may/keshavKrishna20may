-  Fun fact: ### 🐝 Fun Fact: Honey Never Spoils!

Did you know that honey is one of the few foods that never goes bad? 
Archaeologists have discovered pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old—and still perfectly edible! 
The natural sugars in honey create an environment that prevents bacteria from growing, 
giving it an almost indefinite shelf life. 🍯
